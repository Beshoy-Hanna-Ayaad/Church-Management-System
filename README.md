# Church Management System

This project is a full-stack, end-to-end data platform designed to provide real-time analytics, data management, and pastoral care tools for a church community. It was born from a simple observation: without a system to track participation, communities can unintentionally overlook quieter members and fail to challenge talented ones, hindering both fairness and personal growth. This platform was built to replace guesswork with data-driven empathy.

## The Problem Solved
This application addresses several critical, real-world challenges common in community organizations:

- **Inefficient Tracking**: Replaces manual, inconsistent attendance tracking with a reliable, real-time system.

- **Unintentional Bias**: Provides data to ensure special opportunities are distributed equitably, not just to the most visible members.

- **Lack of Proactive Care**: Moves beyond simple reporting to proactively identify students who are showing signs of disengagement, enabling timely support.


## Key Features
The application is a multi-page Streamlit app organized into three core, role-based sections:

### üìà Data Analysis
- **Dashboard**: A strategic overview of key metrics and distributions across all departments.

- **Attendance Analysis**: A powerful tool with a snapshot view for class comparison and an animated bar chart race to visualize engagement trends over time.

- **Student Profile**: A 360-degree view of an individual, featuring at-a-glance KPIs, "last seen" dates for core activities, and a historical trend chart.

- **Target Analysis**: An interactive tool where Priests can define dynamic monthly targets and visualize each student's progress.

- **Students at Risk**: A proactive pastoral tool using a dynamic rules engine to identify students showing signs of disengagement.

- **Opportunity Roster**: A data-driven tool to engineer fairness by recommending students for special activities based on their participation history.

### üìù Data Collection
- **Attendance Entry**: A streamlined, role-specific form with a clean checkbox interface to make daily attendance recording effortless for servants.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Management
- **Admin Panel**: A secure, permission-gated hub for authorized leaders to manage the student lifecycle (e.g., moving classes), update activities, and ensure long-term data integrity.


## Tech Stack
- **Backend & Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

- **Web Framework & UI**: Python, Streamlit

- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas

- **Data Visualization**: Plotly

- **Version Control: Git** / GitHub


## Database Schema
The system is built on a normalized relational database designed for both data integrity and fast, multi-level analysis. The schema is centered around a transactional Attendance table, creating a "star schema" that is highly optimized for analytical queries.
